# XCode 4+ Lua Support #
XCode has by default no support for the lua syntax.
	
## Installation ##
This installation is only for Mac OS X because of the fact that XCode is only for Mac OS X

1. Download the Zip file for this repository.
2. Go with a terminal into on of these directories:
	1. Lua - for the plain lua syntax
	2. Lua-CC - for the lua syntax with the additional Computercraft Api
	3. Lua-CC-MobGui - for the Lua synatx, the Computercraft api and the MobGui Api 
3. Perform this command in the terminal if you are that folder:
	`sudo sh Add-Lua.sh`
	
You now should be able to select the syntax coloring like so:
`Editor -> Syntax Coloring -> Lua`	

If you installed XCode on the normal way over the App Store, then no problems should occur. If any error should occur, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/breinhart/Lua-In-Xcode), because this part of this repo is a fork of another repo.
